# MarioBrosROMData 

The beginnings of a neural network designed to learn how to play Super Mario Brothers on the NES.

So far, all this does is read the ROM's memory and puts the blocks surrounding Mario in a 13x13 table; the eventual input into generated neural networks.

This is done using the Bizhawk emulator and Lua scripts.
